    This mode is a variant of CFB, and it is only used in PGP and
    OpenPGP_ applications. If in doubt, use another mode.

    An Initialization Vector (*IV*) is required.

    Unlike CFB, the *encrypted* IV (not the IV itself) is
    transmitted to the receiver.

    The IV is a random data block. For legacy reasons, two of its bytes are
    duplicated to act as a checksum for the correctness of the key, which is now
    known to be insecure and is ignored. The encrypted IV is therefore 2 bytes
    longer than the clean IV.
